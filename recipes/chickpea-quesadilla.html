        <h3>Spicy, Spinoff Quesadilla Made With A Creamy Cashew Filling</h3>

        <h2>Part 1: Cashew Pseudo-Cheese Sauce</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup raw cashews (boiled until soft)</li>
            <li>½ cup unsweetened plain yogurt*</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water OR vegetable broth</li>
            <li>½ cup salsa of choice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Drain the soaked cashews and pat dry.</li>
            <li>Add the cashews, along with the remaining sauce ingredients, to a high-powered blender. </li>
            <li>Blend until thick, creamy, and smooth.</li>
            <li> The sauce should be quite thick and creamy, but if you would like it to be even thicker, add the sauce to a saucepan over medium-low heat for a few minutes to thicken up slightly.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Part 2: Buffalo Sauce </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup (56g) vegan butter (1/2 stick)</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons Frank hot sauce</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>A pinch of kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons brown sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Melt the vegan butter in a heatproof bowl in the microwave</li>
            <li>To the melted butter, add the hot sauce, garlic powder, cayenne pepper (if using), salt, and sugar.</li>
            <li>Whisk until the hot sauce and butter are completely incorporated.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Part 3: Chickpea Filling</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (15-ounce /425g) can chickpea, drained and rinsed</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Pour the drained and rinsed chickpeas in a medium bowl and roughly mash them with a fork or a potato masher, leaving some beans intact.</li>
            <li>Heat the 2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat and once the oil is shimmering, add the diced onion. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes or until softened, then add the garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute.</li>
            <li>To the onions, add the buffalo-butter sauce and the mashed chickpeas, and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, then turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Assemble the quesadillas. Spread an even layer of the Mexican Cheese Sauce onto one of the eight tortillas. Arrange about 1/2 cup of the Buffalo Chickpea Filling on top. Place another tortilla on top to cover.</li>
            <li>Lightly grease the large skillet with a bit of oil and place over medium heat. Once hot, add the prepared quesadilla to the skillet. Place a smaller skillet on top of the quesadilla so that it presses down on the quesadilla, resulting in a nice crispy exterior.</li>
        </ol>
